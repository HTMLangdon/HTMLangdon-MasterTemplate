<h1>SCSS Architecture Overview</h1>

<h2>File Structure</h2>

<p>The <code>scss/</code> directory contains three folders: Base, UI and Vendor.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Base</strong> contains the “building block” abstractions, namely the grid framework, mixins and helpers. These are core to spaceBase and should not be edited.</li>
  <li><strong>UI</strong> contains all project-specific styles shared across the application. These files are meant to be completely tailored to your project. To start, it includes typography, form elements, generic print styles, buttons and other common UI components. Add more partials and  organize them however the project demands.</li>
  <li><strong>Vendor</strong> contains Normalize and CSS reset. You can add other vendor files here.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Compilation</h2>

<p>All partials are imported into the <code>_manifest.scss</code>. This is also where you can choose to import either Normalize (default) or CSS Reset. When you add new partials to your project, add them to this import list. <code>_manifest.scss</code> is then imported into the two main stylesheets, <code>application.scss</code> and <code>application-ie.scss</code>. Set up your Sass compilation to generate these in the <code>stylesheets/</code> directory. Because of the amount of comments, please use minified CSS in production.</p>

<h3>Legacy IE Support</h3>

<p>After compilation you will have two stylesheets, <code>application.css</code> and <code>application-ie.css</code>. The only difference between these files lies in the <code>$legacy-ie</code> variable. When set to true, the <code>media()</code> mixin will only render the content inside appropriate media query breakpoints. Taking advantage of CSS inheritance, the site will render the desktop layout in legacy browsers that don’t support media queries (IE8 and below). Therefore, these should be loaded into the site via conditional comments.</p>

<p>Example:
~~~html
<!--[if (gt IE 8) | (IEMobile)]><!-->
  <link href="/stylesheets/application.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<!--<![endif]--></p>

<!--[if (lt IE 9) & (!IEMobile)]>
  <link href="/stylesheets/application-ie.css" media="all" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" />
<![endif]-->

### Styleguide

There is a third stylesheet, `styleguide.css`, used only in `styleguide.html`. This file is the start for your project style guide, including grid examples, color swatches, typography, UI and form elements. [What is a style guide?](http://alistapart.com/article/creating-style-guides)


## Global Variables

Customizable variables are stored in the `_vars.scss` partial. This includes things like font styles, colors, breakpoints and base sizing measurements. Use these variables throughout the rest of the project, and add more as you see fit. `_vars.scss` also contains switches to include or exclude features as you need them.

### Vertical Rhythm and the `$base-sizing-unit`

As a means for consistency and good vertical rhythm, many measurements are based off the `$base-spacing-unit`, which is equal to the base `$line-height-ratio`. This way if the `$base-font-size` or `$base-line-height` is adjusted down the road, white space proportions are preserved. For example, unless you opt for using CSS Reset, most block-level elements (headings, lists, paragraphs, etc.) will have a bottom margin equal to `$base-spacing-unit`.


## The Grid

The grid structure comes from version 4 of [inuit.css](https://github.com/csswizardry/inuit.css) with some modifications. It uses proportionally-sized floats with human readable classnames (i.e. one-half, two-thirds, three-quarters, etc). By default, grid gutters (the space between grid elements) are equal to the `$base-sizing-unit` but can be changed in `_vars.scss`. Each set of grid elements must be wrapped in a `grid-wrapper`. Floats can be reversed by adding `grid-wrapper--rev`, and gutters can be removed by adding `grid-wrapper--full`.

Example:
~~~html
&lt;div class="grid-wrapper grid-wrapper--full"&gt;

    &lt;div class="grid two-thirds"&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div class="grid one-third"&gt;
        ...
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<h3>The <code>$responsive</code> Variable</h3>

<p>If <code>$responsive</code> is set to false, the grid will collapse to 100% wide on mobile and only use the  proportional-width classes for breakpoint <code>lap</code> and above. This is ideal for a simple site layout.</p>

<p>If <code>$responsive</code> is set to true, the base grid proportions remain constant across all breakpoints. But by adding classes prefixed with the breakpoint namespace, grid elements can change width at different breakpoints, thereby creating a truly dynamic site layout.</p>

<p>Example:
~~~html
&lt;div class="grid-wrapper"&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="grid one-whole hand-one-half lap-one-third desk-one-quarter"&gt;
    ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/div&gt;
~~~</p>

<p>This would create a <code>div</code> that at the smallest sizes fills the full width of the horizontal space, takes up half of that space at <code>hand</code> sizes, a third of that space at <code>lap</code> sizes, and a quarter at <code>desk</code> sizes.</p>

<h3>Push and Pull</h3>

<p>Push classes move grid items over to the right, creating white space on the left. Pull classes move grid items over to the left, creating white space on the right. Push and pull styles follow the same logic of the <code>$responsive</code> variable. If <code>$responsive</code> is false, they only apply to the <code>lap</code>  breakpoint and above. If <code>$responsive</code> is true, you have access to push and pull classes prefixed with the breakpoint namespace.</p>

<p>Example:
~~~html
&lt;div class="grid-wrapper"&gt;</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div class="grid one-half lap-one-quarter push--one-quarter push--lap-three-eighths"&gt;
    ...
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>&lt;/div&gt;
~~~</p>

<p>To exclude the push/pull styles from the compiled stylesheet, change their variables to <code>false</code> in <code>_vars.scss</code>. Because of the weight they add to the file size, it is advisable to do this if you aren’t using them.</p>
